                      The project is django based and we run the project by running "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal to host the site using the localhost server.

                      The project uses jinja templates to connect with files like images, css, javascripts and many.
                      Then the project is connected to SQL lite as the backend allowing the storage of datas that are entered by the user.
